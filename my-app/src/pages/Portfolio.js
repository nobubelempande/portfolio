    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p class="skill1"> I fell in love with programming from the day I did my first project using Scratch in 2016. Since then, I have become a multilingual young woman with experience in Web development using HTML5 and CSS3, App development with Java, PHP and MYSQL. I have also learnt how to use programming languages such as Python and Mathematica to solve data related problems with the help of mathematical modelling.</p>

    <h3>Team Work</h3>
    <p class="skill2">Over the course of the years, I worked with people either in a school project or in a netball team. I had the priviledge of leading some of the teams I was put in and that allowed me to garner good leadership skills. However, the importance of listening to other people and allowing to be led without shrinking yourself or your ideas is one of the top skill I believe is important when working in a team.</p>
